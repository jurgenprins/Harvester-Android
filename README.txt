Harvester Android client creates a feed of most relevant list of items
from any url. It ties in with the Android browser or runs standalone.

Harvester also attempts to navigate a limited set of subsequent urls as 
well (e.g. down a numbered navigation list)

Harvester items consists of title, short summary, a link to detailed 
information, and optionally an image (thumb).

Relevant item feeds can thus automatically be composed from newsfeeds, 
blog listings but also image galleries such as on flickr.
